This chapter will discuss in more detail ASP’s stereo process and other tools available to either pre-process the input
images/cameras or to manipulate parallel_stereo’s outputs, both in the context of planetary ISIS data and for
Earth images. This includes how to (a) customize parallel_stereo’s settings (b) use point2dem to create 3D
terrain models, (c) visualize the results, (d) align the obtained point clouds to another data source, (e) perform 3D
terrain adjustments in respect to a geoid, etc.haiii file am a second file
